# Tharso Rossiter - Data Analysis Portfolio

Hi! I'm Tharso Rossiter.

This is a portfolio to show my skills in data analysis and modeling.

I graduated with honous in Statistics from the  Universidade Federal de Pernambuco (UFPE), one of the best courses in Statistics in Brazil. In addition to theoretical knowledge, I also have experience in data analysis with R, Python, SQL and Power BI. At the moment, I work for a Brazilian startup named Digibee.

# Portfolio projects

## Tech layoff dashboard

In [this Looker Studio dashboard](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/e64d437b-26c5-4300-8dd5-e6e808439de6) you can visualize data about layoffs in tech companies in 2022-2023.

## Spam mail detection with R using Naive Bayes

In this project, I extracted and cleaned email data and used Naive Bayes to detect spam emails in [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/veleon/ham-and-spam-dataset).

You can view the code and comments on [this Kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/tharso03/spam-mail-detection-with-r-using-naive-bayes) or [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/tharso03/spam-detection-naive-bayes).

## ZINARp R package

I created the ZINARp package as part of my undergraduate thesis. The package is used to model zero-inflated and integer-valued time series unser a bayesian perspective using the ZINAR(p) model, as proposed by Garay et al in the article [Bayesian analysis of the p-order integer-valued AR process with zero-inflated Poisson innovations](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00949655.2020.1754819).

You can read my undergraduate thesis [here](./TCCTharsoRossiter.pdf).

The package is avaliable in [this repository](https://github.com/tharso03/ZINARp). You can download it in R by running the code `install.packages("ZINARp")`.
