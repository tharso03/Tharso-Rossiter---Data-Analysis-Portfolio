# Tharso Rossiter - Data Analysis Portfolio

Hi! I'm Tharso Rossiter.

This is a portfolio to show my skills in data analysis and modeling.

I graduated with honous in Statistics from the  Universidade Federal de Pernambuco (UFPE), one of the best courses in Statistics in Brazil. In addition to theoretical knowledge, I also have experience in data analysis with R, Python, SQL and Power BI. At the moment, I work for a Brazilian startup named Digibee.

# Portfolio projects

## ZINARp R package

I created the ZINARp package as part of my undergraduate thesis. The package is used to model zero-inflated and integer-valued time series unser a bayesian perspective using the ZINAR(p) model, as proposed by Garay et al in the article [Bayesian analysis of the p-order integer-valued AR process with zero-inflated Poisson innovations](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00949655.2020.1754819).

You can read my undergraduate thesis [here](./TCCTharsoRossiter.pdf).

The package is avaliable in [this repository](https://github.com/tharso03/ZINARp). You can download it in R by running the code `install.packages("ZINARp")`.

## Power BI dashboards

I created two dashoards as part of the assignments for completing the Microsoft Power BI Desktop for Business Intelligence. You can view them [here](https://github.com/tharso03/PowerBI).
