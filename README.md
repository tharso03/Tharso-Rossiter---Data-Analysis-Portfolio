# Tharso Rossiter - Data Analysis Portfolio

Hi! I'm Tharso Rossiter.

This is a portfolio to show my skills in data analysis and modeling.

I graduated with honous in Statistics from the  Universidade Federal de Pernambuco (UFPE), one of the best courses in Statistics in Brazil. During my studies I worked as a teaching assistant, intern and researcher in the field of bayesian inference.

In addition to theoretical knowledge, I also have experience in data analysis with R, Python, SQL, Power BI and Looker Studio (formermly, Google Data Studio).

Currently, I work for a Brazilian startup named Digibee.
